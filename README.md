run_analysis.R has to be executed with the dataset being in the same directory as run_analysis.R.

run_analysis.R does the following:
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The code book is given in file CodeBook.md.
